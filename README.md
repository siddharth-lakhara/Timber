# Timber
Timber is a game inspired by [Timber Man](https://store.steampowered.com/app/398710/Timberman/). Its written in C++

## Project setup
To run the project, you need the following:
1. GCC Compiler - [Link](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
2. SFML Library - [Link](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

### Note
Please update the `baseFolder` varible in `main.cpp` file. For some reasons, relative paths were not working on XCode, with SFML, hence this hack has been added
